id: riverBank
name: River Bank
description: A picturesque river bank on your family estate. Lush grass and flowers populate the area. The summer sun beams down on the open landscape and the air is filled with humidity and the smell of pollen. There's a lovely old willow tree close by and some well groomed hedges to the East. Your older sister is sitting under the tree, reading a book that seems to have encapsulated her entire attention. That White Rabbit went East, toward the hedges.

id: landingHall
name: Landing Hall
description: A long low hallway absent of chandeliers, making it rather dark overhead. There's a bend in the hall a few meters ahead. Underneath you is a large pile of leaves and sticks that softened your landing. You briefly see the White Rabbit moving down the hallway south before he turns with the bend.

description: A long, low hallway lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the ceiling. There are several doors lining the hall with a low hanging curtain off to one side of the hallway. There's a small three legged glass table in the middle of the hall. It looks like there's something small on top of the table.

northDesc: That path goes back to the hallway where I landed after falling down the rabbit hole.
southDesc: There's a rather small door behind these low hanging curtains! The door is much too small for me to fit through at my current size. Maybe that key on the glass table will open this door?
eastDesc: This is a rather cozy looking craftsman door. The wood looks very old. I can see vines peaking through the edges of the doorway. It doesn't budge when I try to open it. It feels like it's locked from the other side.

description: A picturesque two story Victorian era home. Vines are growing up the side of the house. There's a well manicured flower garden in the front yard and what appears to be a vegetable garden in the backyard. You are currently in what appears to be the White Rabbit's bedroom. There's a nightstand by the bed and large window that brings in natural light. On the nightstand is the fan and several pairs of white gloves the White Rabbit asked for. However, there's also an enticing looking potion sitting on the table beside the looking glass...

There's a cook wildly stirring and adding ingredients to a large cauldron all while cussing and throwing implements around the house. The fire for the cauldron is producing smoke from end to end of the house. The Duchess is sitting near by the cook on a three legged stool while nursing a rather hideous baby. The is also a rather large cat sitting atop the hearth with an unsettling smile.

description: A beautifully manicured garden befitting royalty. Bright flowerbeds and hedges neatly line the gardens with a large fountain as the centerpiece. The water from the fountain is aerating upon it's flow cycle, causing a fine mist of cool water to populate the immediate area. There is also a large rose tree near the entrance growing white roses. Strangely enough there are three gardeners hastily painting the roses red.

description: The inside of the palace. This is the throne room, which seems to serve a double purpose as a courtroom. High vaulted stone ceilings with supporting arches and large stained glass cathedral like windows line the room. The windows have rather gaudy depictions of the king and queen of hearts on them. Within the throne room the King and Queen sit at their throne. There is a rather large crowd consisting of a zoo of animals as well as the whole deck of card people sitting on rows of pews. Guard cards are spaced out between the individual arches of the throne room standing watch. The White Rabbit is stand near the King with a trumpet and scroll in his hands. The Knave was slumping in chains before the King and Queen with guards on either side of him. A table occupied the space between the Knave and throne with a large dish full of tarts upon it. Off to the side of the King was the juror stand occupied by twelve animals.
