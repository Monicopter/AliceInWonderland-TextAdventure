south_description: There's a rather small door behind these low hanging curtains! The door is much too small for me to fit through at my current size. Maybe that key on the glass table will open this door?
east_description: This is a rather cozy looking craftsman door the wood looks very old. I can see vines peaking through the edges of the doorway. It doesn't budge when I try to open it. Feels like it's locked from the other side with a latch.

[Duchess's Home Interior]
First visit Description: The interior of this home mostly consists of a large open kitchen space. There's a cook wildly stiring and adding ingredients to a large cauldron. The fire for the cauldron is producing smoke from end to end of the house. The Duchess is sitting near by the cook on a three legged stool while nursing a rather hiduous baby. The is also a rather large cat sitting atop the hearth with an unsettling smile.

[March Hare's Home]
Description: An extremely abnormal and large house. The chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. There is a table set out in front of the house under a tree. It looks as though it's set out for a tea party.

[Royal Gardens] 
Description: A beautifully manicured garden befitting royalty. Bright flowerbeds and hedges neatly line the gardens with a large fountain as the centerpiece. The water from the fountain is aerating upon it's flow cycle, causing a fine mist of cool water to populate the immediate area. There is also a large rose tree near the entrance growing white roses. Strangely enough there are three gardeners hastily painting the roses red.

[Croquet Field]
Description: A rather odd area to call a croquet field. The grounds mostly consist of ridges and furrows, not very optimal for playing croquet. Not to mention there is no equipment in sight. Just a bunch of hedgehogs and flamingos roaming the area...

[Royal Palace Beachside]
Description: There was a pathway leading down to the shore from the garden grounds. Waves gently crash against the rocky beach. Ocean mist air fills your lungs. A peculiuar looking animal that looks to be a mix between a pig and and turtle sitting on one of the larger rocks looking rather forlorn. This must be the Mock Turtle!

[Throne Room/Courtroom]
Description: The inside of the palace. This is the throne room, which seems to serve a double purpose as a courtroom. High vaulted stone ceilings with supporting arches and large stained glass cathedral like windows line the room. The windows have rather gaudy depictions of the king and queen of hearts on them. Within the throne room the King and Queen sit at their throne. There is a rather large crowd consisting of a zoo of animals as well as the whole deck of card people sitting on rows of pews. Guard cards are spaced out between the individual arches of the throne room standing watch. The White Rabbit is stand near the King with a trumpet and scroll in his hands. The Knave was slumping in chains before the King and Queen with guards on either side of him. A table occupied the space between the Knave and throne with a large dish full of tarts upon it. Off to the side of the King was the juror stand occupied by twelve animals.
