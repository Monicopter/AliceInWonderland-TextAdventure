[Queen of Hearts]
An oppressive and violent Queen. She is easily angered and quick to order her subject's executions. Be careful what you say.

[King of Hearts]
The Queen's meek and submissive husband. He will often try to calm down the Queen but lacks a spine. He always pardons the victims of the Queens execution orders.

[Cheshire Cat]
A large, mischievous cat that is perpetually grinning. Despite his unsettling appearance, he seems to be the most sane creature in Wonderland.

[Duchess]
An incredibly rude, unpleasant, and hideous woman. Part of the royal court. She is overall an untrustworthy and abusive person.

[Caterpillar]
A giant blue caterpillar that enjoys his alone time atop a mushroom with a hookah. He has a prickly temperament but is wise, if cryptic, in his advice.

[Mad Hatter]
Incredibly eccentric host of the Mad Tea Party. He likes to ask nonsensical questions and has strange mannerisms.

[March Hare]
One of the Mad Hatter's companions for the eternal tea party. Equally as mad as the Hatter.

[Dormouse]
A strange creature with narcolepsy, the third and final guest of the eternal tea party. He is apparently quite the storyteller.

[Mock Turtle]
A melancholic half pig half turtle. He is incredibly self-absorbed and forlorn. He has a penchant for reminiscing.

[Knave]
The Knave of the royal house. Not much is known except his being on trial for thievery of the royal tarts.

[Mouse]
An easily offended French mouse who presumably came over to these lands with William the Conqueror. He hates cats and dogs due to his long, violent history with them.

[Dodo]
A dodo bird that enjoys using refined vocabulary despite the fact that his peers criticise his use of it

[Lory]
The Lory, of whom is most definitely older than Alice. We're not quite sure how old they are, but trust them!

[Cook]
The Duchess' cook. A crude woman of little words but brash behavior. Her favorite pastime is throwing household items at people.

[Pigeon]
This pigeon has been severely wronged by serpents who are trying to steal its eggs. Therefore anything that looks even remotely like a serpent must be so!

[Two, Five, and Seven]
Three stooges who are trying to paint white roses to red to avoid execution by the Queen

[Bill the Lizard]
An unfortunately dull creature who is always on the receiving end of bullying 

[Frog Footman]
A frustrating creature who enjoys speaking absolute nonsense regarding the entry to the house. 

[Gryphon]
A half-lion, half-eagle creature tasked with escorting Alice to meet the Mock Turtle. Seems a decent enough creature, if a bit bossy.

[Pig Baby]
An unfortunately ugly baby who looks more pig than human. Rather sounds like one too, actually...
